## Beyond the Code
A glimpse into some of the activities that bring me joy and balance outside of work.

### Hiking
I enjoy exploring new trails, from quiet local parks to scenic mountain routes. Hiking lets me disconnect from screens and recharge.

### Fitness
I incorporate regular workouts into my routine, from strength training to cardio sessions. Itâ€™s a cornerstone of my focus and overall well-being.

### Cooking
Cooking is a creative outlet where I can experiment with new recipes, try cuisines from around the world, and share meals with friends and family.
