## Career Vision
I am committed to building a career as a **Data Scientist**, with a long-term ambition to expand into **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** roles. My specialization lies at the intersection of **data science, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning** — using these tools to solve high-impact, real-world problems.

## Areas of Specialization
- **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Designing predictive models, optimizing performance, and ensuring interpretability for real-world deployment.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Leveraging text analytics, embedding models, and deep learning architectures to extract insights from unstructured data.
- **Deep Learning:** Applying neural network architectures for complex tasks beyond traditional ML approaches.

## Skill Development Goals
I aim to continuously grow in:
- The **core data science stack** (Python, SQL, data wrangling, feature engineering, model development, deployment).
- **MLOps practices** for scalable, reliable, and maintainable machine learning workflows.
- **Business Acumen** — ensuring my technical work aligns with strategic objectives and delivers tangible value.
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling** — translating technical findings into clear, actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Philosophy
I believe that **data science is only as valuable as the business impact it delivers**. Technical excellence must be paired with strong domain understanding and communication skills to ensure analytics are translated into action. My approach is to bridge the gap between data and business strategy — delivering solutions that are not only accurate, but relevant and impactful.

## Looking Ahead
In the coming years, I plan to:
- Lead projects that integrate **predictive analytics** with operational decision-making.
- Build **end-to-end ML systems** from data ingestion to production deployment.
- Explore advanced NLP and deep learning applications in both structured and unstructured domains.
