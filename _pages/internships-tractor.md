## Overview
Worked on an enterprise-scale machine learning initiative to reduce order cancellations in the Buy Online, Pickup In Store (BOPIS) fulfillment channel, directly impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline in Snowflake using Snowpark (Python + SQL) and Snowflake ML API.
- Developed predictive models at the store-SKU level to identify orders at high risk of cancellation before fulfillment.
- Engineered custom feature sets by integrating order history, inventory movement, store performance, and product attributes.
- Applied techniques such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, optimizing for recall to minimize false negatives.
- Partnered with business teams to ensure model outputs were actionable and integrated into decision-making workflows.
- Automated data ingestion and transformation pipelines to handle millions of records daily.
- Designed visual analytics in PowerBI to monitor prediction performance and highlight operational patterns.

## Impact

- Reduced last-minute order cancellations and improved BOPIS order fulfillment reliability.
- Delivered model insights that were adopted in weekly operational planning across stores.
- $1.5M-$3M in annual revenue lost recapture.
